        message: `Hello group,
        I have this functional component that takes a function as an argument so I can use it.
        I'm usign TypeScript (because my client want's it and I hate it)...
        I tried usign "any" but it doesn't work and doesn't compile with  or without it. 
        Here are the function, how I use it and the error it gives me.
        Any solution to this problem?`,
